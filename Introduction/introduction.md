## 🧠 **What are Data Structures?**

Data Structures are ways of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. They are the foundation of algorithms and impact both the performance and complexity of a program.

### 🏗️ **Types of Data Structures**

1. **Linear Data Structures**: 
   - **Arrays**: A fixed-size container of elements of the same type.
   - **Linked Lists**: A linear collection of nodes where each node points to the next.
   - **Stacks**: Follows the **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle.
   - **Queues**: Follows the **FIFO (First In, First Out)** principle.

2. **Non-Linear Data Structures**: 
   - **Trees**: A hierarchical structure consisting of nodes connected by edges.
   - **Graphs**: A collection of nodes and edges, used to represent networks or relationships.

3. **Abstract Data Types (ADT)**: 
   - **List**, **Set**, **Map**: Data structures that define operations but abstract the implementation.

## 🔍 **Why Data Structures Matter?**

Choosing the right data structure can make your program:
- **Faster** and more **efficient**.
- Easier to **maintain** and scale.
- Capable of solving more **complex** problems.

### **Applications of Data Structures:**
- **Databases**: Use **hash tables**, **B-trees** for indexing.
- **Networking**: Graphs for **routing algorithms**.
- **Machine Learning**: Arrays, Trees, and Heaps are used in algorithms.

## 📝 **C++ Basics**

C++ is a powerful, high-performance language widely used in system programming, competitive programming, and game development. It provides a rich set of features like **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, **memory management**, and a variety of data structures.

### ⚙️ **Setting Up C++ Environment**

To start coding in C++, you need a working compiler:
- **Windows**: Use **MinGW** or **Visual Studio**.
- **Mac**: Install Xcode command-line tools (`xcode-select --install`).
- **Linux**: Install GCC using `sudo apt-get install g++`.
